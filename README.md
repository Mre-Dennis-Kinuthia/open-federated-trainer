# open-federated-trainer
fed-compute is an open MVP federated learning platform for volunteer and edge compute. It coordinates round-based local training across distributed clients, aggregates model updates into a global model, and tolerates partial participation, network instability, and heterogeneous hardware without centralizing data.
